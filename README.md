# Advertising Data Analysis

This is a self-created Data Analytics project focused on understanding how different advertising channels affect sales.

## Problem Statement

Analyze the impact of different advertising mediums (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on product sales. The goal is to identify which medium(s) contribute most to increasing sales.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `TV` – Advertising budget spent on TV
- `Radio` – Advertising budget spent on Radio
- `Newspaper` – Advertising budget spent on Newspapers
- `Sales` – Generated sales in units

## Key Questions Explored

- Which advertising channel is most effective for boosting sales?
- Is there any correlation between budget spent and resulting sales?
- Can we build a simple regression model to predict sales?

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for regression)

## Approach

1. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Correlation Analysis
3. Linear Regression Model
4. Evaluation using R² Score & Residuals

## Conclusion

- TV and Radio ads have a strong impact on sales.
- Newspaper ads contribute the least.
- A multiple linear regression model gives a good prediction accuracy.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me practice:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Statistical correlation
- Building regression models with scikit-learn
